      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact represents the databases component of my CS 499 ePortfolio. It focuses on improving the
        database layer used to store, evaluate, and report access eligibility changes. The enhancement emphasizes
        sound relational design, data integrity, and a structure that supports reliable reporting and repeatable
        processing over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Database Context and Role</h2>
      <p>
        The database supports an eligibility evaluation workflow where source inputs are transformed into a
        reporting-ready representation of access status and changes (“deltas”). Because the database serves as
        the system of record for downstream decisions, the schema and objects must enforce consistency, support
        efficient querying, and preserve a clear history of computed results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Database Design Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Key design considerations included maintaining clear separation between operational data and reporting
        outputs, enforcing consistent keys and relationships, and ensuring that computed results can be audited.
        The enhanced design improves reliability by organizing objects more clearly, supporting consistent joins,
        and reducing ambiguity in how access changes are represented.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Enhancements and Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        The enhancement improves the database artifact by strengthening how access delta results are structured
        and produced. Changes focus on improving consistency of the reporting output, supporting predictable
        queries, and reducing opportunities for data anomalies. This results in a database layer that is easier
        to maintain and better suited for scalable reporting.

      <h2>Supporting Database SQL Artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        The following SQL artifacts demonstrate the database-focused enhancements. The enhanced version reflects
        improvements to database structure and reporting reliability.

      <h2>Use of Instructor Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback from the Milestone One code review was incorporated by making the database rationale clearer
        and improving how the enhancement is communicated. The enhanced artifact more directly connects the
        reviewed issues (clarity, organization, and maintainability) to database-layer improvements that support
        integrity and repeatable reporting outcomes.

      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply database principles to design and evaluate a solution that
        supports reliable data processing and reporting. The enhancement reflects thoughtful schema/object
        organization, attention to data integrity, and design decisions that improve maintainability and support
        future scalability—aligning with CS 499 course outcomes related to databases.
