      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page documents my <strong>Databases</strong> enhancement for CS 499 using the
        <strong>C-Cure Reporting Database</strong> artifact. This SQL Server solution supports
        compliance-driven reporting by producing access eligibility and delta outputs that help
        identify changes requiring action or review.
      </p>
      <p>
        I selected this artifact for the databases category because it demonstrates practical database
        engineering concepts used in real systems: schema organization, integrity and consistency controls,
        performance-aware design, and reporting-focused architecture. These areas are essential when building
        solutions that must remain reliable and auditable over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Original Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        The original solution provided core reporting functionality and generated delta outputs based on eligibility
        evaluation logic. However, there were opportunities to strengthen the database design to improve reliability,
        clarity, maintainability, and performance as data volume and reporting demands grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In production-style database solutions, improvements often involve better organization of database objects,
        stronger integrity enforcement, and performance tuning that reduces execution time and increases predictability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Database Analysis: Areas Identified for Improvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Schema and object organization:</strong> clearer separation of reporting-focused objects and supporting structures
          improves maintainability and reduces confusion for future development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data integrity and consistency:</strong> enforcing consistency through constraints and controlled patterns reduces risk
          of inaccurate reporting outputs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance and scalability:</strong> reporting queries and delta comparisons must remain stable as row counts increase,
          which requires indexing and query patterns that avoid unnecessary scans and expensive operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auditability:</strong> a compliance-driven system benefits from predictable processing and traceable design decisions
          so results can be explained and validated.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Enhancement Implemented: Databases</h2>
      <p>
        For the databases enhancement, I improved database design aspects that support long-term reliability and performance.
        The focus was on strengthening reporting structures and ensuring the artifact reflects best practices used in professional
        SQL Server environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved reporting-focused structure:</strong> enhanced database objects support clearer reporting behavior and more
          predictable delta results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrity-minded design:</strong> design decisions emphasize consistent outputs and reduce the chance of invalid or
          misleading report results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance-aware implementation:</strong> changes support more efficient reporting queries by encouraging selective access
          patterns and database structures that scale with growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintainability:</strong> clearer structure and intent make it easier to extend the system and apply future enhancements safely.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative environments:</strong> Clear organization and documentation support shared understanding and reduce friction
          when multiple stakeholders rely on the same reporting outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional communication:</strong> The narrative and structure explain database decisions in a clear, reviewable format.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algorithmic principles and trade-offs:</strong> Database choices support efficient reporting and delta processing by reducing
          unnecessary work and improving predictability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tools and implementation practices:</strong> Demonstrates use of professional SQL Server database concepts and practices
          aligned to real operational reporting needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security mindset:</strong> Integrity-minded database design supports controlled, auditable outputs and reduces risk of incorrect
          or exploitable behavior in compliance-driven reporting.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This enhancement reinforced that database engineering is more than storing data—it is designing structures that maintain integrity,
        perform consistently, and support reliable reporting for stakeholders. One challenge in database-focused enhancement work is balancing
        performance improvements with clarity and auditability. I addressed that by focusing on maintainable structures and predictable patterns
        that support reporting accuracy while still considering scalability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The enhanced database work complements the other categories: software design improvements make the system easier to maintain, algorithmic
        improvements improve efficiency, and database enhancements ensure the underlying structures support reliable execution and reporting.
