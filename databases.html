      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page documents my <strong>Databases</strong> enhancement for CS 499 using the
        <strong>C-Cure Reporting Database</strong> artifact. This SQL Server solution supports
        compliance-driven reporting by producing access eligibility and delta outputs that help
        identify changes requiring action or review.
      </p>
      <p>
        I selected this artifact for the databases category because it demonstrates practical database
        engineering concepts used in real systems: schema organization, integrity and consistency controls,
        performance-aware design, and reporting-focused architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Original Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        The original solution provided core reporting functionality and generated delta outputs based on eligibility
        evaluation logic. However, there were opportunities to strengthen the database design to improve reliability,
        clarity, maintainability, and performance as data volume and reporting demands grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In production-style database solutions, improvements often involve better organization of database objects,
        stronger integrity enforcement, and performance tuning that reduces execution time and increases predictability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Database Analysis: Areas Identified for Improvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schema and object organization:</strong> clearer separation of reporting-focused objects and supporting structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Data integrity and consistency:</strong> stronger enforcement reduces risk of inaccurate reporting outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance and scalability:</strong> optimized patterns reduce unnecessary scans and expensive operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> predictable processing supports traceable and explainable results.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Enhancement Implemented: Databases</h2>
      <p>
        For the databases enhancement, I improved database design aspects that support long-term reliability and performance.
        The focus was on strengthening reporting structures and ensuring the artifact reflects best practices used in professional
        SQL Server environments.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Collaborative environments:</strong> Clear organization supports shared stakeholder understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional communication:</strong> Database decisions are documented and reviewable.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic trade-offs:</strong> Design supports efficient reporting and delta evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools and techniques:</strong> Demonstrates SQL Server database engineering best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Security mindset:</strong> Integrity-focused design supports controlled and auditable outputs.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This enhancement reinforced that database engineering is more than storing data—it is designing structures that maintain integrity,
        perform consistently, and support reliable reporting for stakeholders. Balancing performance and auditability required
        disciplined structure and predictable implementation patterns.
