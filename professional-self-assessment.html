      <h2>Daniel Lowery</h2>
      <p><strong>CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone</strong></p>
      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program and developing my CS 499 ePortfolio has allowed me to
        transform from a technically capable practitioner into a strategic computer science professional
        who understands not only how systems work, but how they deliver value in complex, real-world environments.
        Throughout this program, I strengthened my foundation in software engineering, data structures, database design,
        and security while applying those skills directly to enterprise integration projects in my professional role.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ePortfolio reflects this growth through the enhancement of the C-Cure Reporting Database project—a
        compliance-driven SQL Server solution that integrates training eligibility data with physical access control systems.
        The enhancements demonstrate deliberate software design decisions, algorithmic improvements, database optimization,
        and security-conscious architecture aligned to industry standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This self-assessment highlights how my coursework and capstone experience showcase my strengths, shape my
        professional goals, and prepare me to continue advancing in enterprise systems architecture and integration engineering.
      </p>

      <h2>Showcasing My Strengths and Professional Growth</h2>

      <h3>Collaboration in a Team Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout both my coursework and professional career, I have worked within collaborative environments involving
        stakeholders across IT, security, compliance, quality assurance, and external vendors. In the CS 499 capstone,
        this collaboration was reflected in producing a structured code review presentation targeted to peers and managers,
        designing enhancements that could be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences, and aligning artifact
        improvements to stakeholder requirements, including maintainability and auditability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In professional practice, I regularly coordinate integration workflows between SAP CPI, SQL Server databases, and
        enterprise systems such as training and access control platforms. The ability to explain technical decisions clearly
        and support organizational decision-making reflects mastery of the collaboration outcome.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication With Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        The development of my ePortfolio strengthened my ability to translate complex database logic into executive-level narratives,
        produce technically sound written documentation, present design decisions through structured explanation, and align communication
        style to the audience (technical peers versus leadership). The professional self-assessment itself demonstrates professional-quality
        written communication that is organized, technically coherent, and aligned to the expectations of employers and stakeholders.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        In the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I improved the efficiency of the Access Eligibility evaluation logic by reducing
        redundant queries, implementing optimized joins and indexing strategies, designing more efficient delta-detection logic, and structuring
        logic to minimize computational overhead. These improvements demonstrate my ability to evaluate trade-offs between readability,
        maintainability, and performance—core principles of algorithmic problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        My understanding of data structures extends beyond academic exercises and into practical relational schema design, indexing strategies,
        and query optimization in SQL Server environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Software Engineering and Database Design</h3>
      <p>
        In the Software Design and Engineering enhancement, I refactored structural components of the system to improve modularity,
        separation of responsibilities, maintainability, and extensibility. The database enhancement introduced improved indexing strategies,
        better schema organization, clearer relational integrity enforcement, and structured reporting layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        These improvements align with software development lifecycle principles learned throughout the program and applied directly to a
        production-style enterprise database solution.
      </p>

      <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        Security has become a foundational principle in my design thinking. In both coursework and professional practice, I have emphasized
        explicit data validation, controlled access to reporting layers, minimization of unnecessary privileges, awareness of potential injection risks,
        and schema-level enforcement of integrity. In enterprise integrations involving compliance data and physical access eligibility, security is not
        optional—it is essential. My enhancements reflect a proactive mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and mitigates risks through structured architecture.
      </p>

      <h2>Alignment to CS 499 Course Outcomes</h2>
      <p>The capstone demonstrates mastery of the following outcomes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Environments:</strong> Through structured code reviews and stakeholder-aligned design decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Through written narratives, structured documentation, and organized GitHub Pages presentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Problem Solving:</strong> Through optimized eligibility evaluation logic and performance-aware SQL design.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovative Techniques and Tools:</strong> Through use of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), structured schema layering, and enterprise integration alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Through integrity constraints, controlled data access patterns, and explicit validation logic.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Each enhancement directly supports at least one of these outcomes, and collectively they demonstrate integrated mastery.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How My Artifacts Fit Together</h2>
      <p>The artifacts in my ePortfolio represent three distinct but interconnected dimensions of computing expertise:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Design &amp; Engineering Enhancement:</strong> Focused on structural refactoring and maintainability improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures Enhancement:</strong> Focused on optimizing eligibility evaluation logic and performance trade-offs.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Enhancement:</strong> Focused on schema design, indexing strategies, integrity enforcement, and reporting architecture.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these enhancements demonstrate that I do not approach problems in isolation. Instead, I evaluate architecture, logic,
        data structure, performance, security, and long-term maintainability. This holistic approach reflects professional-level systems thinking.
      </p>

      <h2>Professional Positioning and Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        This program has reinforced my professional direction toward enterprise systems architecture and integration engineering.
        My career focus centers on enterprise integration design, data governance and compliance systems, secure system interoperability,
        database-driven automation engines, and event-driven architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The capstone project demonstrates that I can analyze existing systems, identify improvement opportunities, design structured enhancements,
        implement optimized solutions, and communicate those solutions effectively. This portfolio positions me not only as a developer, but as a
        systems engineer capable of designing solutions that deliver measurable organizational value.
