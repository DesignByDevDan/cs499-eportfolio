      <h2>Daniel Lowery</h2>
      <p><strong>CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone</strong></p>
      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program and developing my CS 499 ePortfolio helped me grow from a technically capable
        practitioner into a computer science professional who can design, explain, and deliver solutions that create value in
        real-world environments. Throughout the program, I strengthened my foundation in software engineering, data structures
        and algorithms, database design, and secure computing practices, while applying many of those skills directly to
        enterprise integration work in my professional role.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ePortfolio reflects that growth through the enhancement of the <strong>C-Cure Reporting Database</strong>—a
        compliance-driven SQL Server solution that integrates training eligibility signals with physical access control
        reporting requirements. The enhancements demonstrate deliberate design decisions, more efficient and maintainable
        decision logic, stronger database engineering practices, and a security-minded approach aligned with industry expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This professional self-assessment introduces my strengths and professional direction, and it explains how the artifacts
        that follow collectively demonstrate the five CS 499 course outcomes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Strengths / Growth -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Showcasing My Strengths and Professional Growth</h2>

      <h3>Collaboration in a Team Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Across my coursework and professional experience, I have worked in collaborative environments that include IT teams,
        security stakeholders, quality and compliance groups, and external vendors. In CS 499, I approached collaboration by
        creating clear explanations of the system’s purpose and behavior, documenting decisions, and presenting enhancements in
        a way that supports technical review and stakeholder understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In professional practice, I routinely coordinate work across integrated systems and teams where shared understanding is
        essential for dependable outcomes. This portfolio reflects those habits through consistent structure, navigable presentation,
        and narratives that emphasize decision-making context rather than only implementation details.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication With Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        The capstone strengthened my ability to communicate technical work for different audiences. The code review and narratives
        translate complex logic into structured explanations, while still remaining technically accurate. The GitHub Pages format
        reinforces that communication by organizing the work so a reviewer can quickly find the self-assessment, artifacts, and
        supporting materials without friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reflects the professional expectation that engineers not only build systems, but also communicate design intent,
        trade-offs, risks, and results in writing and in presentations.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        In the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I focused on improving how eligibility changes are detected and processed
        so the system produces correct results with less unnecessary work. This included reducing redundant operations, improving the
        clarity of decision logic, and documenting performance considerations so the implementation is both understandable and
        efficient to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        These improvements demonstrate algorithmic problem solving in a practical context: evaluating trade-offs between readability,
        maintainability, and performance, and using structured logic to ensure predictable behavior across edge cases.
      </p>

      <h3>Software Engineering and Database Design</h3>
      <p>
        In the Software Design and Engineering enhancement, I refactored components of the solution to improve modularity,
        separation of responsibilities, maintainability, and extensibility. In the database-focused enhancement, I emphasized
        stronger schema organization, integrity enforcement, and performance-aware design so the database can support reporting
        and operational needs more reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these changes reflect software engineering practices reinforced throughout the program: designing for clarity,
        reducing coupling, supporting future changes, and producing work that can be understood and validated by others.
      </p>

      <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        Security has become a core part of how I think about system design. In coursework and in enterprise environments, I have
        emphasized controlled access patterns, explicit validation, minimizing unnecessary privileges, and reducing design choices
        that increase risk. In systems that influence compliance and physical access eligibility, security is a requirement—not an
        optional feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        My enhancements reflect a proactive mindset that anticipates common vulnerabilities and mitigates risk through disciplined
        design, separation of concerns, and attention to integrity and traceability in database logic.
      </p>

        communication, collaboration, and security.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- How artifacts fit together -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>How My Artifacts Fit Together</h2>
      <p>
        The artifacts in my ePortfolio represent three distinct but connected dimensions of computing expertise:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Design &amp; Engineering Enhancement:</strong> structural refactoring to improve maintainability and extensibility</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures Enhancement:</strong> more efficient and clearly documented logic with attention to trade-offs</li>
        <li><strong>Database Enhancement:</strong> improved schema organization, integrity enforcement, and performance-aware design for reporting needs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these artifacts show that I approach problems holistically—considering architecture, logic, data design, performance, security,
        and long-term maintainability rather than treating each area in isolation.
      </p>
