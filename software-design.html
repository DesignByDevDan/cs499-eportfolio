      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact represents the <strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong> enhancement area for my CS 499 ePortfolio.
        The underlying project is the <strong>C-Cure Reporting Database</strong>, a SQL Server solution designed to support
        compliance-driven access eligibility reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I selected this artifact because it demonstrates real-world system design concerns: maintainability, readability,
        separation of responsibilities, repeatable processing, and clear communication of intent through structure and documentation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Original Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        Before enhancement, the solution supported eligibility evaluation and delta-style reporting outputs.
        However, logic was tightly coupled, harder to follow, and more difficult to extend safely.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Enhancement Implemented</h2>
      <p>
        The enhancement focused on refactoring the stored procedure to improve modularity,
        separation of concerns, naming clarity, and maintainability without altering
        intended functional behavior.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearer separation of data preparation and evaluation logic</li>
        <li>Reduced duplicated logic patterns</li>
        <li>Improved naming consistency</li>
        <li>Added intent-focused documentation comments</li>
        <li>Improved structural readability for safer future modifications</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      </ul>
      <p>
        This version reflects structural refactoring and improved maintainability practices
        compared to the original implementation.

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Environments:</strong> Clearer code structure improves peer review and shared maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Structured documentation and readable organization support stakeholder understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Trade-offs:</strong> Refactoring balances clarity and performance while reducing future defect risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools and Techniques:</strong> Demonstrates professional SQL Server development and refactoring discipline.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Improved structure reduces risk of unintended side effects or logic flaws.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This enhancement reinforced that high-quality software engineering is not only about producing correct results,
        but about creating solutions that are understandable, extensible, and safe to evolve. The refactoring process
        required careful validation to ensure behavior remained consistent while improving structural clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This foundation directly supports the algorithmic and database enhancements that follow.
