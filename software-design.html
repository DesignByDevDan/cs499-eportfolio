      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact represents the software design and engineering component of
        my CS 499 ePortfolio. It builds upon the system analyzed in Milestone One
        and demonstrates how deliberate design decisions and refactoring efforts
        improve maintainability, clarity, and extensibility of the solution.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Goals and Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The primary design goals for this artifact were to improve code organization,
        reduce complexity, and clearly separate responsibilities across components.
        Additional constraints included working within an existing codebase,
        maintaining compatibility with current data flows, and ensuring the design
        could scale as system requirements evolve.

      <h2>Software Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Key design decisions focused on restructuring the code to follow sound
        software engineering principles, including modularity, separation of
        concerns, and readability. Logic that was previously tightly coupled was
        reorganized into clearer functional boundaries, making the system easier
        to understand, test, and enhance.

      <h2>Engineering Improvements and Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering improvements included refactoring for consistency, improving
        naming conventions, and clarifying data flow through the system. These
        changes reduce technical debt and make future enhancements more predictable
        and less error-prone. The refined design also supports clearer integration
        points for additional functionality.

      <h2>Supporting Software Design Artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        The following SQL artifacts demonstrate the software design and engineering
        improvements discussed above. The enhanced version reflects refactoring
        efforts focused on structure, readability, and separation of concerns while
        preserving existing functionality.

      <h2>Use of Instructor Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback from the Milestone One code review was incorporated to improve
        the clarity and organization of this artifact. Specifically, the design
        rationale is now more explicitly documented, and the relationship between
        the original review findings and the resulting design improvements is
        clearly articulated.

      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply software engineering
        principles to the design and evaluation of computing solutions. It reflects
        thoughtful decision-making, structured problem solving, and an emphasis
        on producing maintainable and extensible software systems aligned with
        CS 499 course outcomes.
