      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact represents the algorithms and data structures component of my CS 499 ePortfolio.
        It builds upon the system reviewed in Milestone One and focuses on improving the core logic
        used to evaluate access eligibility and generate “delta” outputs. The enhancement emphasizes
        correctness, efficiency, and clarity of the decision-making process.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Problem Being Solved</h2>
      <p>
        The underlying problem is to recompute access eligibility changes (deltas) based on updated inputs,
        then determine which changes must be applied downstream. The process must reliably identify additions,
        removals, and updates while handling real-world data conditions such as incomplete records, timing
        differences, and repeated runs. The algorithm must be deterministic and maintain consistent results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Algorithmic Approach and Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        The enhancement refines the evaluation and delta-generation logic so that the system minimizes
        unnecessary recomputation and avoids redundant outputs. The enhanced approach prioritizes set-based
        processing, reduces repeated scanning of the same data, and enforces a clear sequence of operations:
        (1) normalize inputs, (2) compute candidate eligibility states, (3) compare current vs prior states,
        and (4) emit only actionable changes. This results in a more efficient and maintainable algorithm.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data Structures and Data Handling</h2>
      <p>
        Although the implementation is written in SQL, the enhancement still demonstrates data structure
        thinking through consistent use of keyed datasets (e.g., person identifiers, policy/group identifiers,
        and effective date windows). The improved logic treats intermediate results as structured sets that can
        be joined and compared reliably, which reduces complexity and improves correctness of delta detection.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Supporting Algorithm SQL Artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        The following SQL artifacts demonstrate the algorithm enhancements. The enhanced version improves
        the correctness and efficiency of delta computation by clarifying evaluation steps and reducing
        redundant processing.

      <h2>Use of Instructor Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback from the Milestone One code review was incorporated by improving organization and making the
        algorithmic rationale more explicit. The enhanced artifact clarifies the processing sequence and better
        communicates how each step contributes to correctness and performance, making the solution easier to
        evaluate and maintain.

      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions with attention to
        algorithmic efficiency and correctness. The enhanced logic reflects structured problem solving and
        improved handling of real-world data conditions, aligning with CS 499 outcomes related to algorithms,
        data structures, and the evaluation of computing solutions.
