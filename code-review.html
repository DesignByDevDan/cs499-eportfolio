      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page contains my Milestone One code review for CS 499. The code review explains the existing
        functionality of my selected artifact (the C-Cure Reporting Database), identifies areas for improvement,
        and describes the enhancement plan that guided my work across the three required categories:
        Software Design &amp; Engineering, Algorithms &amp; Data Structures, and Databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intended audience for this review is a peer developer or manager. The goal is to communicate how the
        system works today, why changes were needed, and what enhancements were implemented to improve quality,
        maintainability, performance, and security.

      <h2>What the Review Covers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Existing functionality:</strong> What the database solution does, its core objects, and how eligibility/delta outputs are produced.</li>
        <li><strong>Code analysis:</strong> Where structure, clarity, reliability, and maintainability could be improved.</li>
        <li><strong>Planned enhancements:</strong> A clear plan for improvements across software design, algorithms, and database engineering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This structure matches the Milestone One expectations: explain how the system works, identify improvement areas,
        then present an enhancement plan aligned to course outcomes.

      <h2>Course Outcome Alignment (Explicit)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative environments:</strong>
          This review is structured for peers/managers to support shared understanding and decision making about next steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional communication:</strong>
          The walkthrough and this page provide clear, organized explanation of the system, improvement areas, and plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algorithmic principles and trade-offs:</strong>
          The review identifies opportunities to improve efficiency and correctness and explains why the planned approach is appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tools and implementation practices:</strong>
          The review demonstrates practical use of SQL Server concepts and structured engineering practices to deliver real reporting value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security mindset:</strong>
          The review considers integrity, controlled access patterns, and risk-aware design choices to reduce vulnerabilities in a compliance-driven system.
