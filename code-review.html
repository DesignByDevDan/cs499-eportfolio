      <p>
        This artifact presents a critical code review of an existing software project
        selected for enhancement in my CS 499 ePortfolio. The review evaluates the
        current implementation, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines planned
        enhancements aligned with course outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This code review has been revised based on instructor feedback from Milestone
        One to improve clarity, organization, and explicit alignment with course
        outcomes. The review more clearly explains the rationale for planned enhancements
        and demonstrates how each enhancement will strengthen the artifact across
        software design, algorithms, and database considerations.

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This code review demonstrates my ability to evaluate computing solutions using
        sound software engineering principles, analyze existing implementations, and plan
        meaningful enhancements that align with the CS 499 course outcomes across software
        design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
