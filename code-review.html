<h1>Milestone One: Code Review</h1>

<p>
  This artifact presents a critical code review of an existing software project
  selected for enhancement in my CS 499 ePortfolio. The review evaluates the
  current implementation, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines
  planned enhancements aligned with course outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  This code review has been revised based on instructor feedback from Milestone
  One to improve clarity, organization, and explicit alignment with course
  outcomes. The review more clearly explains the rationale for planned
  enhancements and demonstrates how each enhancement will strengthen the
  artifact across software design, algorithms, and database considerations.

</ul>

<h2>Course Outcome Alignment</h2>
<p>
  This code review demonstrates my ability to evaluate computing solutions using
  sound software engineering principles, analyze existing implementations, and
  plan meaningful enhancements that align with the CS 499 course outcomes across
  software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
