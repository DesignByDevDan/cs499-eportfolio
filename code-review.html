      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page contains my Milestone One code review for CS 499. The code review explains the existing
        functionality of my selected artifact (the C-Cure Reporting Database), identifies areas for improvement,
        and describes the enhancement plan that guided my work across the three required categories:
        Software Design &amp; Engineering, Algorithms &amp; Data Structures, and Databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intended audience for this review is a peer developer or manager. The goal is to communicate how the
        system works today, why changes were needed, and what enhancements were implemented to improve quality,
        maintainability, performance, and security.

      <h2>What the Review Covers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Existing functionality:</strong> What the database solution does, its core objects, and how eligibility/delta outputs are produced.</li>
        <li><strong>Code analysis:</strong> Where structure, clarity, reliability, and maintainability could be improved.</li>
        <li><strong>Planned enhancements:</strong> A clear plan for improvements across software design, algorithms, and database engineering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This structure matches the Milestone One expectations: explain how the system works, identify improvement areas,
        then present an enhancement plan aligned to course outcomes.

      <h2>Planned Enhancements Summarized</h2>

      <h3>Software Design &amp; Engineering</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Refactor complex logic into clearer, more maintainable structure</li>
        <li>Improve naming consistency and separation of concerns</li>
        <li>Increase readability so future changes are safer and faster</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve efficiency of delta detection (reduce redundant processing)</li>
        <li>Clarify evaluation steps to ensure deterministic results</li>
        <li>Document trade-offs between performance and maintainability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Databases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthen data integrity and reporting reliability</li>
        <li>Improve schema/object organization to support auditing and repeatable processing</li>
        <li>Support scalability through clearer structures and performance-aware design</li>
      </ul>
